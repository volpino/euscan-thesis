\chap{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Alberto Montresor for his encouragement and support during the writing of this composition.

My work would have never been carried out without the help of Corentin Chary (Gentoo developer, my mentor for the Google Summer of Code, first Euscan author and Senior Reliability Engineer at Google), Carol Smith (Open Source Program Manager at Google), Brian Dolbec, Michał Górny and the whole Gentoo community.

I acquired a big part of my knowledge about web and Python development during my work activities and thanks to the passion of my colleagues, I’m very grateful to the <imgsrc and SpazioDati teams for the good time spent together.
I would like to also thank Davide Kirchner, Andrea Nodari, Matteo Poletti and all the other fellow students of my course for their support during this three years of studying.
